            <h1>Acuris is Online</h1>
            <p>
              Acuris Systems is a new, forward-thinking company seeking to bring
              innovative solutions to NZ’s agriculture industry. Update blogs
              like this one will be posted every few months to provide
              information on the company and details on our technology. In this
              update we’ll talk a little about the company’s goals and then give
              an overview of the history of the company and the development of
              our technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the information age every industry is looking to data
              collection to improve their business. We spoke to Kiwifruit
              orchardists in New Zealand and quickly realised there was a demand
              for fruit counting and canopy analysis information, but farms had
              grown too large for this to be possible using manual methods. We
              decided to focus on this issue, but while our current focus is on
              solving this problem, and solving it well, our goal is to push our
              robots to be able to do anything on an orchard that saves labour
              time and cost. Our aim is also for the robots to be able to
              operate in multiple locations and differing situations, such as
              other sectors of the agriculture industry.

              <h2>v1-2: Goddard, and Goddard mk2</h2>
              <p>
                As with the development of all innovative technologies, it hasn’t
                been an easy road. The first Acuris robot prototype, Goddard, was
                assembled in Matt’s apartment living room. Goddard performed
                admirably, allowing the team to test early robot operating systems
                and camera setups. A complete refit created Goddard MK2. Second
                phase testing showed that the drive system and the constraints of
                the prototype chassis were an issue, which led to the development
                of the third prototype.

              <h2>v3: Marvin</h2>
              <p>
                After Goddard, we also decided that an overhaul of the robot’s
              design was required, so our third version was created to be
              completely temporary and easy to test with and edit. Marvin was
              made with a wooden base to enable redesign and production of the
              chassis as rapid as possible. Marvin was in use for less than a
              year, but allowed our team to test a number of sensors and key
              systems while designing version 4. We planned to make this version
              as close as possible to the final roll-out design.

              <h2>v4: Anubis</h2>
              <p>
                Anubis is the current, functional prototype producing working
              small-scale kiwifruit scans as we write. It has four-wheel
              independent steering and four-wheel drive as well as suspension
              that allows it to manoeuvre even on rough terrain. Also featuring
              dual cinema grade 4k cameras for canopy mapping, the compute power
              of a gaming computer and enough sensors to rival state
              surveillance, Anubis is a truly capable, adaptable robotics
              platform.

              <h2>v5</h2>
              <p>
                Version 5 will be Acuris’ final rollout robot. Anubis’ chassis and
              drive design require minimal updating, making V5 essentially an
              under-the-hood update. The aim of these updates is to increase ease
              of manufacture. Our previous robots have been many-month
              labours of love, but with our engineers all out of love, our new
              version is made to be assembled almost entirely by machine cutting
              and 3D printing. V5 is designed to be more modular, with extra
              open internal and external spaces for future technological
              developments. There are also many reliability and servicing
              considerations that are being incorporated into the latest
              version.
